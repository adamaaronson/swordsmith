## Crossword

Represents a collection of crossing slots and the words they contain. A slot is a unique tuple of squares, and a square is a unique tuple of coordinates. Every slot has a corresponding word whose `i`th character corresponds to the `i`th square of the slot. Words can be filled, partially `EMPTY`, or completely `EMPTY`.

If two slots contain the same square, their words "cross" at that square and their letters corresponding to that square must be the same.

### Fields
- `slots`
	- Set of slots in the crossword
- `squares`
    - Dictionary of dictionaries that keeps track of which slots contain which squares
    - square => slot => index of square within slot
- `crossings`
    - Dictionary of dictionaries that keeps track of which slots cross each other
    - slot => slot => square where the slots cross
- `words`
	- Dictionary mapping each slot to its corresponding word
	- Updated as grid is filled
- `wordset`
	- Set of filled words in the grid
	- Used for dupe detection
	- Updated as grid is filled

### Static Methods
- `is_word_filled(self, word)`
	- Returns whether `word` is completely filled

### Methods
- `put_letter(self, slot, i, letter)`
	- Places given `letter` at `i`th square of given `slot`
	- Does not update crossing slots
- `put_word(self, word, slot, add_to_wordlist=True)`
	- Places `word` in the given `slot`
	- By default it should add it to the wordlist if it isn't already included, but if a filler is restoring a previous word then `add_to_wordlist` can be set to `False`
	- Updates words in crossing slots using `put_letter`
- `is_dupe(self, word)`
	- Returns whether `word` is a dupe, i.e. whether it's already in the `wordset`
- `is_filled(self)`
	- Returns whether every square in the grid is non-`EMPTY`

## American Crossword

Represents a special case of the crossword that consists of a two-dimensional grid of black and white squares, where every maximally contiguous horizontal or vertical sequence of white squares is a slot. Black squares are also called blocks and they are not a part of any word.

### Fields
- `rows`
	- Number of rows in the grid
- `cols`
	- Number of columns in the grid
- `grid`
	- `rows` by `cols` array of characters representing the letters in each square of the grid

### Class Methods
- `from_grid(cls, grid)`
	- Generates a crossword from 2D array of characters

### Static Methods
- `is_across_slot(slot)`
    - Determines whether the given slot is an Across slot
- `is_down_slot(slot)`
    - Determines whether the given slot is a Down slot

### Methods
- `get_clue_numbers_and_words(self)`
    - Returns dictionaries of across and down words, indexed by their numbers à la newspaper crossword
- `put_block(self, row, col)`
	- Places `BLOCK` at given square
- `put_blocks(self, coords)`
	- Places `BLOCK` at all of the given squares in the list `coords`
- `__generate_grid_from_slots(self)`
    - Processes `slots` to refresh the grid array
    - Called whenever the grid is about to be printed, in case the contents of the slots have changed
- `__generate_slots_from_grid(self)`
	- Processes `grid` array to generate the across and down slots
	- Called whenever grid shape changes

## Wordlist

Contains the collection of words to be used while filling a crossword, as well as the pattern-matching functionality for filling an incomplete slot.

### Fields
- `words`
	- Set of words in the wordlist
- `added_words`
	- Set of words that weren't originally in the wordlist, but were added while the program was running
- `pattern_matches`
	- Dictionary that holds matches for previously searched patterns
- `indices`
    - Dictionary mapping length to index to letter to set of words
    - Used for simulating database indexing
- `lengths`
    - Dictionary mapping length to words
    - Used for finding matches for completely unfilled slots

### Methods
- `add_word(self, word)`
	- Adds `word` to the wordlist
- `remove_word(self, word)`
	- Removes `word` from the wordlist
- `get_matches(self, pattern)`
	- Returns list of words in the wordlist that match `pattern`
	- `pattern` is a string with any number of wildcard (`EMPTY`) characters

## Filler

Abstract base class containing useful methods for filling crosswords.

### Abstract Methods
- `fill(self, crossword, wordlist, animate)`
	- Fills the given `crossword` using some strategy
	- Can optionally `animate` the filling process by printing out the grid at each step

## Static Methods

- `get_new_crossing_words(crossword, slot, word)`
	- Returns words that would cross the given `slot` if the given `word` was entered into it, without actually placing the `word` in
	- Used for `minlook` heuristic and `is_valid_match`
- `is_valid_match(crossword, wordlist, slot, match)`
    - Returns whether the `match` can be placed in the `slot` without creating a dupe or invalid word.
- `fewest_matches(crossword, wordlist)`
	- Returns the unfilled slot in the grid with the fewest matches according to the `wordlist`, as well as its number of matches
	- Used as a next-slot heuristic
- `minlook(crossword, wordlist, slot, matches, k)`
	- Randomly looks at `k` possible `matches`
	- Returns index of match that yields the most possible crossing words if it were placed in the `slot`, as well as the indices of matches that immediately cause inconsistencies
	- Determines number of crossing words by computing the sum of logarithms of crossing match counts
	- Used for `minlook` and `arc-consistency` heuristic

## DFSFiller

Implementation of `Filler` that uses a naive DFS algorithm.

### Methods
- `fill(self, crossword, wordlist, animate)`
	- If the grid is already filled, just return `True`
	- Choose next slot to fill using `fewest_matches` heuristic
		- If `num_matches` is zero, crossword is unfillable, return `False`
	- Randomly iterate through all possible matches for that slot
		- If the match can be placed without creating a dupe or invalid word, then recurse
	- If none of the matches worked, restore the slot's previous word and return `False`

---

## DFSBackjumpFiller

Implementation of `Filler` that uses a DFS algorithm with backjumping.

### Methods
- `fill(self, crossword, wordlist, animate)`
	- If the grid is already filled, just return `True`
	- Choose next slot to fill using `fewest_matches` heuristic
		- If `num_matches` is zero, crossword is unfillable, return `False` and the failed slot
	- Randomly iterate through all possible matches for that slot
		- If the match can be placed without creating a dupe or invalid word, then recurse
		- If a recursive call failed on a slot that this slot doesn't cross, backjump by giving up on this slot and passing along that failed slot
	- If none of the matches worked, restore the slot's previous word and return `False` along with the failed slot

---

## MinlookFiller

Implementation of `Filler` that uses a minlook heuristic.

### Fields
- `k`
	- Number of potential matches to look ahead to at each fill step

### Methods
- `fill(self, crossword, wordlist, animate)`
	- If the grid is already filled, just return `True`
	- Choose next slot to fill using `fewest_matches` heuristic
		- If `num_matches` is zero, crossword is unfillable, return `False`
	- Use `minlook` to look ahead to at most `k` random matches and find the one that yields the most possible crossing matches
		- Throw out both the chosen match and the failed matches from the matches list
		- If the chosen match can be placed without creating a dupe or invalid word, then recurse
		- If the chosen match didn't work and there are more matches to try, use `minlook` again
	- If none of the matches worked, restore the slot's previous word and return `False`

		- Throw out both the chosen match and the failed matches from the matches list
